### I have been a backend specialized developer my entire career, so this is a shot at creating a fully functioning static website that doesn't use any backend framework. It makes API requests, is single-page, responsive for mobile and tablets, and will serve as a general playground for my frontend learning in the future. Thanks for checking it out!
